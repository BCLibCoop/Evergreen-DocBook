    </info>
    <para>Evergreen is an open source library automation software designed to meet the needs of the very smallest to the very largest libraries and consortia.  Through its staff interface, it facilitates the management, cataloging, and circulation of library materials, and through its online public access interface it helps patrons find those materials.</para>

It has an active development and user community, as well as several companies offering migration, support, hosting, and development services.</para>
