= Call Number Prefixes and Suffixes 2.1

This feature will be available in Evergreen version 2.1.

*Abstract*

In Evergreen version 2.1, you can configure call number prefixes and suffixes in the Admin module.  This feature ensures more precise cataloging because each cataloger will have access to an identical drop down menu of call number prefixes and suffixes that are used at his library.  In addition, it may streamline cataloging workflow.  Catalogers can use a drop down menu to enter call number prefixes and suffixes rather than entering them manually.  You can also run reports on call number prefixes and suffixes that would facilitate collection development and maintenance.
