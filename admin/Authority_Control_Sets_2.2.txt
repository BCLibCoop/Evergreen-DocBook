= Authority Control Sets 2.2

This feature will be available in Evergreen version 2.2.

*Abstract*

The tags and subfields that display in authority records in Evergreen are proscribed by control sets.  The Library of Congress control set is the default control set in Evergreen.  In Evergreen release 2.2, you can create customized control sets for authority records.  Also, you can define thesauri and authority fields for these control sets.

Patrons and staff will be able to browse authorities in the OPAC.  The following fields are browsable by default: author, series, subject, title, and topic.  You will be able to add custom browse axes in addition to these default fields.

*Thesauri*

A thesaurus describes the semantic rules that govern the meaning of words in a MARC record. The thesaurus code, which indicates the specific thesarus that should control a MARC record, is encoded in a fixed field using the mnemonic Subj in the authority record.  Eleven thesauri associated with the Library of Congress control set exist by default in the staff client.  

To access an existing thesaurus, click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Control Sets*, and choose the hyperlinked thesaurus that you want to access, or click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Thesauri*.


To add a *Thesaurus*:

1) Click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Control Sets*, and choose the hyperlinked thesaurus that you want to access, or click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Thesauri*.

2) Click *New Thesaurus*.

3) Add a *Thesaurus Code*.  Enter any single, upper case character.  This character will be entered in the fixed fields of the MARC record.

*Authority Fields*


Authority fields indicate the tags and subfields that should be entered in the authority record.  Authority fields also enable you to specify the type of data that should be entered in a tag.  For example, in an authority record governed by a Library of Congress control set, the 100 tag would contain a "Heading - Personal Name."  Authority fields also enable you to create the corresponding tag in the bibliographic record that would contain the same data. 

==== To create an *Authority Field*:

1) Click *Admin* -> *Server Administration* -> *Authorities* -> *Control Sets*.

2) Click *Authority Fields*.  The number in parentheses indicates the number of authority fields that have been created for the control set.
