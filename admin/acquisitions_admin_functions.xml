	<title>Administration Functions in the Acquisitions Module</title>
	<abstract>The following documentation is intended for users who will be managing funds and providers, managing EDI accounts, and creating drop 	down menus for invoices and purchase orders. This 
	documentation will describe the purpose of each menu item in the Acquisitions menu in the Admin module and will present instructions for using each item. Front line processes are documented in The 
	Acquisitions Module. This document is intended for first time users of the Acquisitions module as well as those who are familiar with the module and need only a 	reference guide. The 
	contents of this document are ordered such that one who is new to the Acquisitions module could read through this document and set up the administrative portion of Acquisitions in Evergreen.

	<title>Currency Types</title>
	<simpara>Currency types can be created and applied to funds in the administrative module.
	When a fund is applied to a copy or line item for purchase, the item will be purchased in
	the currency associated with that fund.</simpara>

<section id="acq_admin_exchange_rates">
	<title>Exchange Rates</title>
	<simpara>Exchange rates define the rate of exchange between currencies. Evergreen will automatically calculate exchange rates for purchases.
	Evergreen assumes that the currency of the purchasing fund is identical to the currency of the provider, but it provides for two unique
	situations:
	If the currency of the fund that is used for the purchase is different from the currency of the provider as listed in the provider
	profile, then Evergreen will use the exchange rate to calculate the price of the item in the currency of the fund and debit the fund
	accordingly.
	When money is transferred between funds that use different currency types, Evergreen will automatically use the exchange rate to convert
	the money to the currency of the receiving fund. During such transfers, however, staff can override the automatic conversion by providing
	an explicit amount to credit to the receiving fund.</simpara>

	Funds are created for a specific year, either fiscal or calendar. These funds are owned
