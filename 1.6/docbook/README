I made a few minor adjustments to my DocBook distribution to experiment with rendering in
the PDF file. These don't change the HTML file created, just the PDF file;

I currently have DocBook installed on a Fedora-12 system in the directory tree:
        "/usr/local/src/docbook-xsl-1.75.2".

================================================================================
The changes outlined below were made to the file:
        "/usr/local/src/docbook-xsl-1.75.2/fo/param.xsl"
which should appear in all DocBook installations that use the FO rendering engine,
which is part of the DocBook toolchain that we use.

I provided the modified version of the file "param.xsl", and a list of patch differences
in the file "diff.txt".

To apply the changes, just backup the original file, then replace it with the modified file.
No other changes to the toolchain are required.

To see the changes, just re-run "xsltproc" on an .XML file that already contains links or
figures and you should see the updates in the PDF file created.
================================================================================




An outline of my changes follows:
---------------------------------
1. Changes were motivated by my realization that you can't identify <link>s to other chapters
   or documents within the PDF file.
   Now all links are rendered in blue, underlined italic text for easy identification.

   modify section "xref.properties":
        set property "font-style" to italic;
        set property "text-decoration" to underline;
        set property "background-color" to blue;

2. Changes were motivated by my desire to draw attention to figures or diagrams.
   Now all figures are rendered in small text (75% the size of normal text), and a
   background color is added to the figure to differentiate it from the surrounding
   document.

   add new section "figure.properties";
        set property "background-color" to grey;
        set property "font-size" to 75%

3. Changes were motivated to see if I could do it :)
   Now all sections within an <abstract/> tag are rendered in italic font.

   modify the section "abstract.properties";
        set property "font-style" to italic;
