      <para>If their permission settings allow, staff members can make items bookable. Staff members
         can do this in advance of a booking request, or they can do it on the fly.</para>
      <para>If you know in advance of the request that an item will need to be booked, you can make
         the item bookable.</para>

         <step>
            <para>The <guilabel>Record Summary</guilabel> will appear. In this view you can see

            <para>The <guilabel>Holdings Maintenance</guilabel> screen will appear. In this screen,
               you can view the volumes and copies of an item avaialable at each branch. To view the
               barcodes and other information for each copy, click the arrow adjacent to the branch
               with the copy that you need to view. Click on successive arrows until you find the

         <para>In Evergreen 1.6.1, there is no way to make an item “unbookable” after it has been
            made bookable and has been reserved. The <guibutton>Delete Selected</guibutton> button
            on this screen deletes the resource from the screen, but the item will be able to be

      <title>Create a Bookable Status for Non-Bibliographic Items</title>
      <para>Staff with the required permissions can create a bookable status for non-bibliographic
         items. For example, staff can book conference rooms or laptops. You will be able to create
         types of resources, specify the names of individual resources within each type, and set
         attributes to describe those resources. You can then bring the values together through the

         <step>
            <para>A box will appear in which you will create a type of resource. In this box, you
               can set fines, determine “elbow room” periods between reservations on this type of
               resource, and indicate if this type of resource can be transferred to another

         <step>
            <para>A box will appear in which you can add the attributes of the resource. Attributes
               are descriptive information that is provided to the staff member when the booking
               request is made. For example, an attribute of the projector may be a cart that allows
               for its transportation. Other attributes might be number of seats available in a
               room, or MAC or PC attributes for a laptop. Click <guibutton>Save</guibutton> when
               the necessary information has been entered.</para>

      <!-- Pages 14-16 of source document from http://evergreen-ils.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=booking ommitted at conversion (Jeremy Buhler, Oct 6 2010).  Rationale: subject is covered elsewhere in the Book of Evergreen and it confuses 'working location' with 'home library', both of which should already be set for all staff accounts. -->
