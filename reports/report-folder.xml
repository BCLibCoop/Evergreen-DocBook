    <para>There are three main components to reports: <guilabel>Templates</guilabel>, <guilabel>Reports</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Output</guilabel>. Each of these
        components must be stored in a folder.  Folders can be private (accessible to your login only) or shared with other staff at your library, other libraries in your system or consortium. It is also possible to selectively share only certain folders and/or subfolders. </para>

    <informalfigure>
        <para>There are two parts to the folders pane. The <guilabel>My Folders</guilabel> section
            contains folders created with your Evergreen account. Folders that other users have
            shared with you appear in the <guilabel>Shared Folders</guilabel> section under the username of the sharing account.</para>

        <para>Whether you are creating a report from scratch or working from a shared template you must first create at least one folder.</para>
        
        <para>The steps for creating folders are similar for each reporting function. It is easier
            to create folders for templates, reports, and output all at once at the beginning, though it is
            possible to do it before each step. This example demonstrates creating a folder for a template. </para>


        <procedure>
            <step>

		</step>

            <step>
                    <para>Name the folder. Select <guimenuitem>Share</guimenuitem> or
                            <guimenuitem>Do not share</guimenuitem> from the dropdown menu.</para>

                    <para>If you want to share your folder, select who you want to share this folder
                        with from the dropdown menu. </para>
            </step>

                    <para>Next, create a folder for the report definition to be saved to. Click on

            <step>
             
                    <para>Finally, you need to create a folder for the reportâ€™s output to be saved
                        in. Click on <guilabel> Output</guilabel>.</para>
            </step>
	<step>
                <para>Repeat steps 2-5 to create an <guilabel>Output</guilabel> folder named <guilabel>Circulation</guilabel>.</para>

		<para>Using a parallel naming scheme for folders in <guilabel>Templates</guilabel>, <guilabel>Reports</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Output</guilabel> helps keep your reports organized and easier to find</para>
        </tip>
            <para>The folders you just created will now be visible by clicking the arrows in
                <guilabel>My Folders</guilabel>. Bracketed after the folder name is whom the
                folder is shared with. For example, <guilabel>Circulation (BNCLF)</guilabel>
                is shared with the North Coast Library Federation.
                If it is not a shared folder there will be nothing after the folder name.  You may create as many folders and sub-folders as you like.</para>

        <para>Once a folder has been created you can change the name, delete it, create a new
            subfolder, or change the sharing settings. This example demonstrates changing a folder name; the
            other choices follow similar steps</para>
