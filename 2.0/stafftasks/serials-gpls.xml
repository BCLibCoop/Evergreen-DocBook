    <title>The Serials Module</title>
<simpara>This documentation is intended for users who will be ordering subscriptions, distributing issues, and receiving issues in Evergreen  . 0.   Specifically, this tutorial documents the functionality in the serials module and illustrates a basic serials workflow in which the user will register a subscription to a serial publication; distribute issues of that publication to branches; define the captions to be affixed to each issue; specify details of the publication pattern; predict future issues, and receive copies of an issue.  Claiming serials is not available in  . 0.  This document also includes a list of administrative permissions that users must have to use the serials module.</simpara>

	<title>Serial Control View, Alternate Serial Control View, and MFHD Records: A Summary</title>
	<simpara>Serial Control View and Alternate Serial Control View offer you two views of Serials.  Both views enable you to create subscriptions, 
	add distributions, define captions, predict future issues, and receive items.  Serial Control View was designed for users who work with a 
	smaller number of issues and was designed to accommodate workflows in academic and special libraries.  Alternate Serial Control View was 
	designed for users who receive a larger number of issues and was designed for use in public libraries.</simpara>
	<simpara>The views are interoperable, but because the views were designed for different purposes, some differences emerge.  For example, 
	Serial Control View enables you to create and edit serials in a single tabbed interface while Alternate Serial Control View leads you through 
	a series of steps on multiple screens.  In addition, receiving functions vary between views.  Both receiving interfaces enable you to 
	batch receive issues.  However, the Serials Batch Receive interface, which is associated with Alternate Serial Control View, allows for 
	more customization of each receiving unit while the Items tab in Serial Control View allows for greater flexibility in creating multi-issue 
	units, such as in binding serials.</simpara>
	<simpara>MFHD records that you created in  . 6 will also exist in  . 0.  Pre-existing MFHD records will display above the holdings summary 
	for serials created in Alternate Serial Control View.  See simplesect  .  . 2 for an example of this display.  If you create a serial in 
	Serial Control View, the generated holdings and the previous MFHD record will display in a single holdings summary, separated by a comma.  
	You can also create new MFHD records manually.</simpara>

<section id="_copy_templates_for_serials">
	<title>Copy Templates for Serials</title>
	<simpara>A copy template enables you to specify item attributes that should be applied by default to copies of serials.  You can create one 
	copy template and apply it to multiple serials. You can also create multiple copy templates.  Templates will be used in the Alternate 
	Serial Control View or the Serial Control View.</simpara>

		<title>Streams</title>
		<simpara>Distributions work together with streams to indicate the number of copies that should be sent to each branch.  Distributions 
		identify the branches that should receive copies of a serial.  Streams identify how many copies should be sent to each branch.  Streams 
		are intended for copies that are received on a recurring, even if irregular, basis.</simpara>
		<simpara>In our example, the Apex Branch should receive copies, so we created a distribution to that branch.  The Apex Branch should 
		receive two copies, so we will create two streams to that branch.</simpara>
		<simplesect>
		<title>Create a stream</title>	
		<simpara>Click the hyperlinked title of the distribution.  The number of streams that have already been created for this distribution

	<title>Captions and Patterns</title>
	<simpara>The Captions and Patterns wizard allows you to enter caption and pattern data as it is described by the 853, 854, and 855 MARC tags.  These tags allow you to define how issues will be captioned, and how often the library receives issues of the serial.</simpara>
	<simpara>In  2.0, it is not possible to create a caption and pattern and apply it to multiple subscriptions.  However, you can re-use patterns if you copy and paste to and from the pattern code field in the Captions and Patterns tab.</simpara>

Price - If you entered a price in the copy template that you created for this subscription, then it will appear by default in the distributions.  You can also manually enter a price if you did not include one in the copy template.
</simpara>
</step>
<step>
<simpara>
Receive? – The boxes in the Receive? Column are checked by default.  Uncheck the box if you do not want to receive the item.  Evergreen will retain the unreceived copies and will allow you to receive them at a later time.
