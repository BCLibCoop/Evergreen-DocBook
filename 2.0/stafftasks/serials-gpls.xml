    <title>The Serials Module</title>
<simpara>This documentation is intended for users who will be ordering subscriptions, distributing issues, and receiving issues in Evergreen  . 0.   Specifically, this tutorial documents the functionality in the serials module and illustrates a basic serials workflow in which the user will register a subscription to a serial publication; distribute issues of that publication to branches; define the captions to be affixed to each issue; specify details of the publication pattern; predict future issues, and receive copies of an issue.  Claiming serials is not available in  . 0.  This document also includes a list of administrative permissions that users must have to use the serials module.</simpara>

	<title>Serial Control View, Alternate Serial Control View, and MFHD Records: A Summary</title>
	<simpara>Serial Control View and Alternate Serial Control View offer you two views of Serials.  Both views enable you to create subscriptions, 
	add distributions, define captions, predict future issues, and receive items.  Serial Control View was designed for users who work with a 
	smaller number of issues and was designed to accommodate workflows in academic and special libraries.  Alternate Serial Control View was 
	designed for users who receive a larger number of issues and was designed for use in public libraries.</simpara>
	<simpara>The views are interoperable, but because the views were designed for different purposes, some differences emerge.  For example, 
	Serial Control View enables you to create and edit serials in a single tabbed interface while Alternate Serial Control View leads you through 
	a series of steps on multiple screens.  In addition, receiving functions vary between views.  Both receiving interfaces enable you to 
	batch receive issues.  However, the Serials Batch Receive interface, which is associated with Alternate Serial Control View, allows for 
	more customization of each receiving unit while the Items tab in Serial Control View allows for greater flexibility in creating multi-issue 
	units, such as in binding serials.</simpara>
	<simpara>MFHD records that you created in  . 6 will also exist in  . 0.  Pre-existing MFHD records will display above the holdings summary 
	for serials created in Alternate Serial Control View.  See simplesect  .  . 2 for an example of this display.  If you create a serial in 
	Serial Control View, the generated holdings and the previous MFHD record will display in a single holdings summary, separated by a comma.  
	You can also create new MFHD records manually.</simpara>

<section id="_copy_templates_for_serials">
	<title>Copy Templates for Serials</title>
	<simpara>A copy template enables you to specify item attributes that should be applied by default to copies of serials.  You can create one 
	copy template and apply it to multiple serials. You can also create multiple copy templates.  Templates will be used in the Alternate 
	Serial Control View or the Serial Control View.</simpara>
