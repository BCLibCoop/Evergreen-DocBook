<info><title>Running Recurring Reports</title></info>


    <para>Recurring reports are a useful way to save time by scheduling reports that you run on
        a regular basis, such as monthly circulation and monthly patron registration
        statistics. When you have set up a report to run on a monthly basis you’ll get an email
        informing you that the report has successfully run. You can click on a link in the
        email that will take you directly to the report output. You can also access
        the output through the reporter interface as described in <xref linkend="view-output"
        />.</para>
    
    <para>To set up a monthly recurring report follow the procedure in <xref
        linkend="generate-report"/> but make the changes described below.</para>
    <procedure>
        
        <step>
            
                <para>Select the <guilabel>Recurring Report</guilabel> check-box and set the
                    recurrence interval to 1 month.</para>
        </step>
        
        <step>
           
                <para>Do not select <guilabel>Run ASAP</guilabel>. Instead schedule the report
                    to run early on the first day of the next month. Enter the date in
                    YYYY-MM-DD format. </para>
	 </step>
        
        <step>
           <para>Ensure there is an email address to receive completion emails. You will
                receive an email completion notice each month when the output is ready. </para>
         
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>Select a folder for the report’s output. </para>
        </step>
        
        <step>
                <para>Click <guibutton>Save Report</guibutton>.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
           <para>You will get a confirmation dialogue box that the <guilabel>Action
                Succeeded</guilabel>. Click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. </para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    
    <para> You will get an email on the 1st of each month with a link to the report
        output. By clicking this link it will open the output in a web browser. It is
        still possible to login to the staff client and access the output in
        <guilabel>Output</guilabel> folder. </para>

        <title>How to stop or make changes to an existing recurring report?</title>
        <para>Sometimes you may wish to stop or make changes to a recurring report, e.g. the
            recurrence interval, generation date, email address to receive completion email,
            output format/folder or even filter values (such as the number of days overdue). You
            will need to delete the current report from the report folder, then use the above
            procedure to set up a new recurring report with the desired changes. Please note
            that deleting a report also deletes all output associated with it.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <tip>
        <para>Once you have been on Evergreen for a year, you could set up your recurring
            monthly reports to show comparative data from one year ago. To do this select 
            relative dates of 1 month ago and 13 months ago. </para>
